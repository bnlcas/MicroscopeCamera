# Microscope Camera
This repository contains code to setup and run the camera on AmScope MD35 camera for an AmScope Microscope. This is a work in progress intended to enable the use of this camera for basic scientific explorations. Please do not expect easy use. This requires open frameworks with the following pacakges:

* OpenCV
* ofxOpenCv
* ofxGUI
* Possibly some additional libraries as functionality expands...
